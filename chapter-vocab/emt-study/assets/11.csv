aerobic metabolism, metabolism that can proceed only in the presence of oxygen
aerosol-generating procedure, any airway manipulation that induces the production of aerosols that may present a risk for airborne transmission of pathogens such as CPR
agonal gasps, abnormal breathing pattern characterized by slow gasping breaths sometimes seen in patient in cardiac arrest
airway, the upper airway tract of the passage above the larynx which includes the nose mouth and throat
alveolar minute volume, the volume of air moved through the lungs in 1 minute minus the dead space calculated by multiplying tidal volume (minus dead space) and respiratory rate
alveolar ventilation, the volume of air that reaches the alveoli. it is determined by subtracting the amount of dead space air from tidal volume
american standard safety system, a safety system for large oxygen cylinders designed to prevent the accidental attachment of a regulator to a cylinder containing the wrong type of gasping
apnea, absence of spontaneous breathing
apneic oxygenation, a technique in which oxygen administered via a high-flow nasal cannula is left in place during an intubation attempt allowing for continuous oxygen delivery into the airways during all phase of the procedure
aspiration, in context of the airway the introduction of vomitus or other foreign material into the lungs
ataxic respirations, irregular ineffective respirations that may or may not have an identifiable pattern
automatic transport ventilator (ATV), a ventilation device attached to a control box that allows the variables of ventilation to be set. It frees the EMT to perform other tasks while the patient is being ventilated
bag-mask device, a device with a one-way valve and a face mask attached to a ventilation bag; when attached to a reservoir and connected to oxygen it delivers more than 90% supplemental oxygen
barrier device, a protective item such as a pocket mask with a valve that limits exposure to a patient's body fluid
bilateral, a body part or condition that appears on both sides of the midline
